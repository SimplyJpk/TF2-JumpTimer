# TF2-JumpTimer
Timer that can be used for Jump Servers, primarily created for JustJump AU

Editing sourcemod scripts I find oddly challenging, and as such the plugin is broken down into more bite-size scripts, each script is named roughly for what it does within the main script. 

At a later date I may combine these to further simplify compiling the plugin for other users, but at this time, this is easiest for me.
